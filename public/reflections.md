# **List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but needs further practice/discussion and why.**

1. **Git, GitHub, and VSCode**  
I understand that Git is a version control system and GitHub is an online platform to store and share code. We also use VSCode as our main editor for coding projects. Even though I know the basics, I still need more practice with commands like git add, git commit, and git push because I sometimes forget the order or what they exactly do. Getting better with Git and GitHub is important because they are tools we will use a lot in coding projects.

2. **JavaScript Number Objects**  
Number objects in JavaScript help us work with values in different ways, like rounding, converting, or checking if something is a number. I know they are important, but I get confused with the many different methods and when to use them. For example, I sometimes mix up parseInt(), parseFloat(), and Number(). This is why I need more practice so I can use the correct method at the right time.

3. **Nested Loops**  
Nested loops are loops placed inside another loop, and they are useful for working with more complex data like tables or grids. I know the basic idea of how they run, but I often get mixed up about which loop is controlling what. Sometimes the output doesn’t look right because I lose track of how many times the loops are running. More practice with real examples would help me understand this better.

4. **Event Handlers**  
Event handlers are used to make programs interactive by responding to things like clicks, typing, or mouse movements. I know the purpose of event handlers, but I sometimes forget the exact syntax or where to place them in my code. It can get confusing when there are multiple events happening at the same time. I need more practice so I can confidently use them to build interactive programs.

5. **Summative Assessments (Long Tests)**  
The summative assessments helped me realize what I understood and what I still struggled with. I could describe many of the questions, but during the tests I sometimes made mistakes because I wasn’t fully confident with certain topics. This shows me that I need to review more before big tests. With more practice and studying, I think I can do much better in the next assessments.

# **List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but needs further practice/discussion and why.**

1. **Git and GitHub**  
The first topic I know and can describe but need more practice on is the use of GitHub and Git. I know it is important to use for organizing our codes and for submissions, but some functions are still a bit confusing now. Sometimes I have to transfer a code from VSCode to GitHub and it doesn’t work properly. I can fix this by reviewing the correct steps for committing and pushing files, and by practicing the commands until I remember them better.

2. **JavaScript Basic Statements**  
The next topic I need more practice on is JavaScript Generating Output. There are many ways to output like console.log() for debugging, alert() for pop-ups, etc. I know their purpose when I see them but I get confused when I need to use them. I also sometimes mess up on case sensitivity.

3. **Number Properties**  
Another topic I know but need more practice on is Number Properties. Things like parseFloat, Math.floor, and other math-related functions can be confusing. Most people, including me, sometimes mix them up because they look similar but do slightly different things. It can also be hard to remember when to use them, especially since some round numbers down, some keep decimals, and others change the number completely. I think I just need more examples and practice to clearly see the differences.

4. **Nested Loops**  
Another topic I know but need more practice on is Nested Loops. I understand that they are loops inside other loops, and the outer loop controls how many times the inner loop runs. What makes them confusing is keeping track of the counters and knowing which loop is running at a certain time. Sometimes I also mix up where to place break or continue, and it affects how the loop works. I think I need more practice tracing them step by step to avoid mistakes.

5. **Event Handlers**  
Another topic I know but need more practice on is Event Handlers. I know they are used to make web pages interactive, like when clicking a button or typing in a form, but I still get confused about the syntax and which event to use. Sometimes I also forget where to place the event in the HTML or JavaScript file. Practicing more examples of common events like onclick or onchange would help me understand better.
